## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Initiate npm project

So far we use codesandbox to create a template (aka a project), and pull it down locally. Here we are learning how to initiate a project locally and push to the cloud.

## Open project folder

Before you initiate an npm project, **Open folder** where you want you project root to be.

## Terminal: npm init

```{bash}
## in your terminal
npm init
```

-   It will goes through basic setups and an **package.json** file is created. However, you need to create your own entry point program file.

-   The setup is a vanilla node.js project. It does not support **React.js**
